Per their records, he had been having fevers for several days.  It was considered that he could have a nasal source from chronic dobhoff.  Ceftaz was started, and then was changed to meropenem several days prior to admission.  He has continued to spike through that and motrin. . He has poor baseline functional status, and is not able to relate any complaints.  Comparing records, his mental status appears to be better on admission than it had been since his discharge.  He had some green diarrhea on the day prior to presentation and his blood sugars had been very high for the past several days (300\\'s). . Of note, patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-10-26**] after prolonged admission since [**2198-8-2**], originally admitted for convulsive status epilepticus. He was treated for his seizures, which were felt secondary to his elevated ammonia level. He also developed sepsis and was started on CVVH. His blood cultures at that time had coag negative staph and vanco-sensitive enterococcus. He also had an episode of VT and an echo at the time revealed a decreased EF of approximately 40%. . ED Course: He was hypotensive to 60s on arrival.  He was given aggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was in in acute renal failure.   A subclavian line was placed.  Past Medical History: PMHx: - NASH cirrhosis, on transplant list - HCC - Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension - Seizure disorder - Hypothyroidism - GERD - CHF, TTE in [**2198-8-10**] demonstrated LVEF 40% with regional LV wall motion abnormalities, which was new as compared to [**3-/2198**] (EF at that time was >55%. - CAD, s/p cardiac cath in [**2187**] for planned PTCA of RCA which failed secondary to occlusion and dissection; followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - Hyperlipidemia - UGIB s/p TIPS [**12/2197**]  Social History: Remote smoking history, married.  Currently lives at [**Hospital1 **].  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission:  Physical Examination: VS Tm 101.2 Tc 97.4  98/52  78  28  100% on 35% trach mask General: Elderly, ill appearing male, lying in bed, NAD HEENT: MMdry, white film on tongue, poor dentition, PERRL Neck: supple, no LAD, trach in place, JVP flat Lungs: Coarse BS bilaterally Cardiac: Regular, II/VI HSM at apex, no S3 or S4 Abdomen: obese, sl distended, nt, pos BS GU: No scrotal edema Extr: Trace LE swelling.  Upper extremities with 2+ pitting edema in the forearms. Skin: Stage 2 coccyx ulcer. Neuro: Arousable, followed simple commands like open mouth or eyes.  Can barely move hands, and is not able to move toes.  Pertinent Results: EKG: NSR 78 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, deep q in II, III, aVF. GOod RWP.  Consistent with prior from [**2198-2-14**]. . Imaging: . CXR: Persistent atelectasis within the right perihilar region and left lung base. Tip of right subclavian central venous catheter overlie the proximal right atrium. Recommend partially withdrawing. . Abd u/s [**11-2**] FINDINGS: There is no ascites identified in the abdomen. No new liver masses are identified, and there is no biliary dilatation identified. Doppler examination of the TIPS shunt demonstrate flow within the shunt which is wall- to-wall, however, the distal portion of the shunt shows some narrowing. Velocities within the TIPS shunt are 30, 96, and 282 in the proximal, mid and distal portions respectively. Elevated velocities within the distal portion are concerning for a distal stenosis. Flow in the main portal vein is hepatopetal and is 44 cm/sec. Some flow away from the TIPS shunt is identified within the anterior right portal vein. Flow within the left portal vein is still demonstrated towards the TIPS shunt on this exam.  Brief Hospital Course: A/P [**11-11**]: 63M h/o ESLD [**1-19**] NASH, HCC, seizure disorder, DM2, hypothyroidism, poor baseline mental status (unable to speak, unable to move extremities at baseline per wife), admitted from rehab via [**Name (NI) **] with fevers, hypotension, profound dehydration, and electrolyte derangements, now with improved mental status after rehydration. . # Fevers/hypotension: His initial presentation was felt to be concerning for sepsis in light of fevers prior to admission. Patient was determined to be severely hypovolemic in the ED, and was given 7 liters of normal saline.  His BP improved and has since remained stable.  The possible sources of infection were felt to include decubitus ulcer, GI/diarrhea, UTI, pulmonary. He was initially covered with linezolid with history of VRE, which was switched to daptomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole for broad coverage.  His chest x-ray showed no pneumonia.  He had no recurrent fevers and blood and urine cultures and stool C. diff were negative.  His antibiotics were subsequently removed and his vitals remained stable.  Given this clinical picture, hypovolemia from dehydration rather than sepsis was considered the most likely cause of hypotension. . # Seizures: Patient had a recent prolonged admission with refractory seizures, necessitating pentobarbital coma at one point.  Seizures during his prior admission were primarily absence in nature, as he would stare off and become non-responsive, but no rhythmic motions were noted.  The Epilepsy service was consulted to assist with management of his several anti-epileptics.  Given his low albumin, corrected phenytoin levels (goal 20-30) and free phenytoin levels (goal 2-2.5) were followed.  His phenytoin dose was slightly decreased.  Continuous EEG monitoring x 2 days demonstrated slow background but no rhythmic epileptiform activities, ruling out subclinical seizures.  He was continued on his prior regimen of phenytoin (at a lower dose), zonismaide, levetiracetam, and topiramate.  He was also placed on lorazepam 0.75 mg TID for seizure prophylaxis in the setting of lowered seizure threshold.  His phenytoin dose was further decreased to 150mg per PEG TID after his free phenytoin level returned elevated at 2.9.  He should have a free phenytoin level checked on [**2198-11-16**] and again on [**2198-11-19**], and the results should be communicated to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3506**].  She will determine any further dose adjustments.  He should also continue on his current dose of lorazepam until [**2198-11-26**], when it should be decreased to 0.5mg IV Q8H.  He was discharged on these medications with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70525**].  Please contact her at the above number for any questions regarding his antiepileptic medication regimen. . # AMS: Although patient is minimally responsive to commands, this current mental status and functional status (rigidity and limited ability to move extremities) is his new baseline. Wife stated patient is the \"best\" he has been since [**2198-7-18**].  He had periods of increased lucidity with orientation to person and place.  His ammonia was followed and was found to be higher than previous levels.  He was maintained on lactulose and his rifaximin was increased.  Antiepileptic management as above.  He remained at his baseline mental status for the remainder of his stay. . # UGIB: On [**11-8**], patient had coffee-ground emesis.  His Dobhoff was removed and tube feedings were held.  Noticed some brown mucous at trach site.  NG lavage showed coffee grounds but no bright red blood.  His Hct was stable from prior days at 24.9. He received 3 U PRBCs with an increase in his Hct to 30.9.  His aspirin and SC heparin were held, and he was placed on a PPI [**Hospital1 **].  EGD on [**11-9**] showed small hiatal hernia and grade B esophagitis with contact bleeding in the lower third of the esophagus.  PEG tube was placed on [**11-9**] and he has been tolerating tube feeds.  His hematocrit has remained stable at 29.  His SC heparin was restarted.  Consider holding aspirin for 2 weeks (to restart on [**11-18**]) to allow mucosa to heal, in light of risk of recurrent life-threatening GI bleeding.  He was maintained on a PPI. . # Hypernatremia:  Hypernatremia to 166 on admission was considered most likley due to hypovolemia given his clinical exam and improvement with replacement of his 8L free water deficit.  He also received free water boluses via PEG tube.  His sodium level remained stable. . # CAD: Patient has history of CAD, and had elevated troponin on admission, but was unable to give a history of chest pain. Acute renal failure was considered a possible contributor to elevated troponin levels, and his CK trended downwards.  His beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor were initially held in the setting of hypotension.  His aspirin was held in the setting of an upper GI bleed as above.  His home beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor were restarted after he remained stable after GI bleed.  His blood pressure has remained stable. . # Decubitus ulcer / heel blisters: Pt was admitted with stage 2 ulcer on coccyx and pressure blisters on heels.  Wound care and Plastic Surgery consults were obtained and recommendations followed.  A rectal tube was placed for hygiene and he may need fecal diversion in the future.  Patient will need follow up with Plastic Surgery post-discharge. . # ESLD/cirrhosis: He has a history of HCC and NASH cirrhosis, and is s/p TIPS after a GI bleed.  He was previously considered for liver transplant but has been delisted due to his baseline mental status.  A RUQ US was performed on admission with some concern for TIPS stenosis.  IR assessed the TIPS under fluoroscopy and found mild narrowing but no hemodynamically significant stenosis.  His ammonia level was found to be elevated from baseline as above, although his mental status remained at baseline.  He was maintained on lactulose and his rifaximin was increased. . # Pancytopenia: Patient was found to be pancytopenic (but not neutropenic) on admission, with low platelets and leukopenia thought likely secondary to chronic liver disease/sequestration, and low hematocrit thought likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.  His WBC and platelet counts remained stable.  His hematocrit was stable after resuscitation from GI bleed as above.  Further workup was deferred to the outpatient setting. . # ARF: Creatinine was 1.9 on admission (greatly increased from baseline of 0.5), considered likely prerenal given hypovolemia. It improved greatly with fluid resuscitation and has remained stable at 0.4-0.5. . # DM2 uncontrolled with complications: Prior to admission, fingersticks had been trending upwards at rehab.  NPH and RISS titrated to maintain FS <150.  On ACE-inhibitor as above. . # Hypothyroidism: Continued home regimen of levothyroxine 200mcg daily. . # Respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy: No respiratory difficulties during this admission with stable oxygen saturation on baseline 35% trach mask.  Speech and Swallow service was consulted, and patient was fitted for Passy-Muir valve. . # FEN: Patient has tolerated tube feeds via PEG tube at goal rate.  Hypovolemia on admission was corrected with aggressive fluid resuscitation.  Patient subsequently developed anasarca due to low albumin state, although respiratory status was not compromised.  He was given occasional doses of IV furosemide for gentle diuresis.  Hypernatremia as above. . # PPX: Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis was maintained.  SC heparin was also administered, with temporary hold in setting of GI bleed. On PPI. . # Communication: Wife . # Access: PICC placed. . # Full code . # Dispo: Patient was determined medically stable and was discharged to rehab. .

History of Present Illness: Patient is a 68 yo F, h/o cervical CA, radiation cystitis, radiation colitis, frequent line infections, recurrent UTIs who presented after developing acute on chronic severe abdominal pain. Four days prior to admission, patient woke with severe abdominal pain that was worsened with movement. She had some dysuria in the days prior. She also complained of nausea and vomiting. Her abdominal pain was worsened by movement. She denied fevers or chills. . She was brought by ambulance to an outside hospital. There she had a CT of her abdomen which was notable for mild ascites, but no acute process. She was mildly hypotensive to SBP of 90s and was given 3 L NS. Given levofloxacin/flagyl. She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. On arrival T 100.8, hr 107, bp 100/71. Soon thereafter SBP dropped to the 70s and she was bolused a total 5L NS. Her ostomy output was heme negative. U/A showed gross blood and + WBC. She was given one dose of meropenem 500mg IV, as this is what she was discharged on previously. Her pain was also treated with tylenol and dilaudid. She became mildly hypotensive with dilaudid. Pt was then transfer to the MICU her VS were T 98, 120/51, 15, 99/ra. . On arrival to the ICU, she again become hypotensive and required levophed. She also recieved one unit of PRBCs for HCT of 22. She was continued on meropenem for presumed urosepsis, and had received a total of 8L of IV fluids while in the ICU.  She was then transferred to the floor after she stabilized on [**3-13**]. . The morning of [**3-14**], she was noted to be in marked respiratory distress.  Her oxygen saturation at times dropped to 80% on non-rebreather, and was noted to be hypertensive into the 160s systolic.  She was given 20mg lasix x 2, her usual dose of dilaudid and hydralazine without marked improvement, and the MICU resident was called.  Examination demonstrated bilateral crackles and JVP elevated to the angle of the mandible.  CXR demonstrated marked pulmonary edema.  She was given nitroglycerin SL and transferred to the ICU for possible initiation of BIPAP. . When she arrived in the ICU, her respiratory status had markedly improved and she denied any shortness of breath or chest pain. She continued however to have abdominal pain.  Past Medical History: 1.

IMAGING: [**2126-3-11**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**2-11**], there is some increased opacification at the left base, which does not silhouette the hemidiaphragm or left heart border. Although this could conceivably represent a region of pneumonia, it more likely reflects artifact of soft tissues pressed against the cassette. No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. Tip of the central catheter again lies in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. . [**2126-3-12**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis w/ con: 1. New moderate ascites and small bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of abscess or pyelonephritis. 2. Unchanged fullness of the left renal pelvis, likely due to UPJ obstruction. 3. Stable moderate common bile duct dilation in this patient who is post-cholecystectomy. . [**2126-3-16**] CT Chest w/o con: 1. Extensive fibrotic changes and ground-glass opacity suggestive of pneumonitis such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug toxicity or NSIP. 2. No evidence of edema or pneumonia. . [**2126-3-18**] ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-10-30**], mild mitral regurgitation is now seen. . [**2126-3-19**] chest x-ray: In comparison with the study of [**3-18**], there has been decrease in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, consistent with improving pulmonary edema or hemorrhage. Blunting of the costophrenic angle on the right persists consistent with a small effusion. Increasing opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural effusion and some volume loss. Central catheter remains in place. . [**2126-3-21**] KUB: Dilated loops of bowel in the left mid abdomen up to 4.8 cm which raise concern for small-bowel obstruction. CT provides more specific information if clinical concern remains. . [**2126-3-21**] KUB: Supine and upright abdominal radiographs were obtained. A dilated loop of bowel in the left lower quadrant measures 4.8 cm and is essentially unchanged in four hours. Surgical clips project over the mid abdomen and pelvis. A calcified right breast implant is seen. Dilated bowel loop remains concerning for small-bowel obstruction. . [**2126-3-22**] CT abdomen:1. Multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections, with rim enhancement and pockets of air, highly suspicious for abscess. 2. Interval development of marked left hydronephrosis. 3. Status post right nephrectomy. Appearance of fluid-filled tubular structure at the expected location and course of the right ureter. If the patient did not have right ureteral resection, this could represent a urine-filled right ureteral stump. Recommend clinical correlations. 4. Thickened, diffuse bladder wall, likely radiation change such as radiation cystitis. 5. No bowel obstruction. Oral contrast has reached the RLQ ileostomy bag. . [**2126-3-25**] Abd US:1. A small subhepatic fluid collection measuring 4.5 cm. Previously seen right paracolic gutter and pelvic fluid collections are not well visualized. Please note that ultrasound is less sensitive for detecting loculated intra-abdominal fluid collections. 2. Stable appearance of the mild intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. 3. Moderate left hydroureteronephrosis, slightly improved since the prior study. . At time of discharge, intraabdominal fluid culture pending (prelim result no growth to date).   Brief Hospital Course: MICU Course: [**Date range (1) 70244**] # Sepsis of likely urinary origin: Upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-11**], had blood pressure drop to 70s sytolic. She was given 5L IVF in ED and transferred to MICU. CXR was unrevealing. U/A showed increased leuks and WBC on urine micro. Was empirically started on meropenem in MICU given that patient had recently been on carbapenems for a UTI in end of 1/[**2126**]. In MICU her BP was intially stable and then fell and patient was started on norepinephrine, which she remained on for approximately 17 hours on [**3-12**]. Given patients severe abdominal pain, received a CT abd/pelvis in the ED which showed moderate ascites, though no other acute changes. Surgery consult was called and felt that there was no acute surgical intervention indicated and followed the patients course in the MICU. We also trended patient's lactate level, which was 3.2 at presentation and trended down to 1.3 with fluid resuscitation. Checked cdiff toxin, which was negative. IV team was called to assist in managment of patient's tunneled double lumen catheter and they suggested ethanol dwells between TPN infusions in order to prevent line infection. Blood cultures from [**3-11**] and [**3-12**] were negative. . # Abdominal pain: Pain with severe abdominal pain upon presentation. We reassured after ruling out acute intra-abdominal process with CT scan and serial exams. Given frequent (Q1hour) IV dilaudid requirements on morning of [**3-13**], pain service consult was called; however, prior to pain service seeing patient her pain improved to point that dilaudid could be given less frequently. Was felt that we had been behind on pain control after sleeping overnight, possible due to held doses of gabapentin. She was continued on methadone, dilaudid, and gabapentin. . # Anemia: HCT was found to be 22, pt was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs. Post-transfusion HCT was 26.9. . Medicine Floor Course: [**Date range (1) 32116**]: Patient was called out from the MICU on [**2126-3-13**] after she had been normotensive for 24 hours without pressors. She had a new oxygen requirement (94% on 4L) thought [**2-20**] volume overload (8 L + for LOS). Overnight, she was hypertensive to 188/80. In the morning she was found to be hypoxic to 81% on 4L. She was put on a non-rebreather with intermittent improvement of her oxygen sats to low 90s but would then drop to low 80s. She was also given iv lasix 20 mg x 2 and she put out 2 L in 2 hours. Her blood pressure was treated with hydralazine 20 mg iv x1 and SL nitro. Despite these interventions she was still hypoxic in the 80s on a non-rebreather and was transferred back to the MICU for positive pressure ventilation and aggressive diuresis. . MICU Course: [**Date range (1) 97780**]: CXR was c/w volume overload, likely from fluid resuscitation she received in the MICU. She was diuresed with IV lasix and started on azithromycin for atypical pneumonia coverage. CT chest performed later revealed extensive fibrotic changes and ground-glass opacities suggestive of pneumonitis such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug toxicity, or NSIP. Pneumonitis workup was initiated. ESR =83, CRP = 188.2, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, Beta-glucan, and galactomannan were all negative. She was stable and was transferred to the floor for further evaluation.  . Medicine Floor Course: [**Date range (1) 20494**]: Pt was stable and continued to improved. Active issues: . # Hypoxemia/Pulmonary infiltrates: Oxygenation gradually improved and pt was weaned off oxygen supplement gradually. Etiology of infiltrates was unclear, possibilities included [**Name (NI) **] and medication-induced lung toxicity. Pt received 1 course of azithromycin for possible atypical pneumonia. Her flu and legionella screenings were negative. She was weaned off O2 and mantained 95%+ saturation on room air at the time of discharge. . # Urosepsis: Pt remained hemodynamically stable on the floor. She received meropenem for total of 7 days ([**Date range (1) 28666**]). She remained without urinary complaints. Pt was given Hyoscyamine for bladder spasm pain. . #Anemia: The patients hematocrit trended down throughout her hospitalization from around 27 to a low of 22. Her baseline over the last few months has been 25-28. This was attributed to her ongoing inflammation secondary to her radiation enteritis and cystitis, although the precise etiology remains unclear, and infection and myelodysplasia should be considered as well. Her manual reticulocyte count was found to be 1.7 (corrected 0.53), indicating insufficient marrow response.  Her ostomy output was found to be guiac negative and her C+ CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no evidence of active bleeding. Hemolysis labs demonstrated no evidence of ongoing hemolytic process, however corrected retic count was low. This can be due to illness or medication suppression. Recent iron studies were all within normal limits. Pt was instructed to follow up with primary care physician about this issue, with repeat Hct/reticulocyte count and further workup as needed. . # Abdominal pain/fluid collections: The patient had known chronic abdominal pain related to cervical cancer and radiation complications. C. diff was been negative. We continued her home medication (methadone and oxycodone), and added dilaudid. Pt was able to eat and drink, and did not have any vomiting. She was evaluated with KUB for possible obstruction, which showed dilated loops of bowel. CT of abdomen demonstrated multiple fluid collections, enlarged fluid filled bladder, L hydronephrosis, and a dilated fluid filled ureteral stump. Urology was consulted, and a foley was placed for decompression. When the patient was taken for CT-guided drainage of the collections, the collections had almost completely disappeared, potentially related to decompression from the foley catheter. Fluid from the remaining collection was sampled and sent for culture and analysis, which demonstrated no bacteria and a creatinine of 1.8 (not consistent with urinoma). Repeat ultrasound demonstrated interval resolution of the previoulsy noted hydronephrosis and stable appearance of the fluid collections compared to the most recent CT scan. . Chronic issues: . # CKD: Pt Cr remained at her her baseline, and no new acute issues. . # Short Gut Syndrome: We continued pt's TPN and she was also followed by the nutritionist while she was in the hospital. . # Anxiety/depression: We continued pt's home meds (alprazolam, fluoxetine). . # Chronic Pain/Fibromyalgia: We continued the pt's home meds (gabapentin, methadone). . # Hypothyroidism: We continued the pt's home med (levothyroxine). . # Osteoporosis: We continued the pt's home med (vitamin D, calcium). . #HTN: We restarted pt's Lisinopril on [**3-19**] after her blood pressure returned to its chronically high level.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Urosepsis, anemia, pulmonary infiltrates, hydronephrosis, abdominal fluid collections   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - with assistance.   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 13275**], . It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**]. You were admitted for a severe infection of the urinary tract, anemia, low blood pressure and shortness of breath. . -For your urinary tract infection, you were given a course of IV antibiotics and your infection resolved. . -For your low blood pressure, you were given IV fluids and medications to help maintain your blood pressure initially. Your low blood pressure was related to your urinary tract infection and improved as this issue improved. After you returned to your baseline blood pressure (high), we restarted your blood pressure medication. . -For your anemia, you were transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells. You should follow up regarding this issue with your primary care doctor as an outpatient. . -For your shortness of breath, you were given oral antibiotics, supplementary oxygen and diuretics, and you improved. We think that your shortness of breath may have been related to an adverse reaction to a blood transfusion that you received. You will follow up as outpatient at the pulmonary clinic (see below). . -For your abdominal pain, we obtained a CT scan which initially showed multiple fluid collections in your abdominal cavity. These collections resolved spontaneously following placement of a foley catheter, and so we suspect that they were related to your bladder. We took you to interventional radiology to sample fluid from one of these collections, and found no evidecne of infection. You were also followed by urology, who recommended keeping the foley in place until you have an appointment with them in 2 weeks. . We made the following changes to your medications: CHANGED Oxycodone 5mg 1-2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours to PO Dilaudid 2mg 1-2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain. . STARTED Hyocyamine 0.125mg SL every 6 hours as needed for bladder spasm STARTED Clotrimazole 1 troc by mouth 4 times a day.

Per their records, he had been having fevers for several days.  It was considered that he could have a nasal source from chronic dobhoff.  Ceftaz was started, and then was changed to meropenem several days prior to admission.  He has continued to spike through that and motrin. . He has poor baseline functional status, and is not able to relate any complaints.  Comparing records, his mental status appears to be better on admission than it had been since his discharge.  He had some green diarrhea on the day prior to presentation and his blood sugars had been very high for the past several days (300\\'s). . Of note, patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-10-26**] after prolonged admission since [**2198-8-2**], originally admitted for convulsive status epilepticus. He was treated for his seizures, which were felt secondary to his elevated ammonia level. He also developed sepsis and was started on CVVH. His blood cultures at that time had coag negative staph and vanco-sensitive enterococcus. He also had an episode of VT and an echo at the time revealed a decreased EF of approximately 40%. . ED Course: He was hypotensive to 60s on arrival.  He was given aggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was in in acute renal failure.   A subclavian line was placed.  Past Medical History: PMHx: - NASH cirrhosis, on transplant list - HCC - Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension - Seizure disorder - Hypothyroidism - GERD - CHF, TTE in [**2198-8-10**] demonstrated LVEF 40% with regional LV wall motion abnormalities, which was new as compared to [**3-/2198**] (EF at that time was >55%. - CAD, s/p cardiac cath in [**2187**] for planned PTCA of RCA which failed secondary to occlusion and dissection; followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - Hyperlipidemia - UGIB s/p TIPS [**12/2197**]  Social History: Remote smoking history, married.  Currently lives at [**Hospital1 **].  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission:  Physical Examination: VS Tm 101.2 Tc 97.4  98/52  78  28  100% on 35% trach mask General: Elderly, ill appearing male, lying in bed, NAD HEENT: MMdry, white film on tongue, poor dentition, PERRL Neck: supple, no LAD, trach in place, JVP flat Lungs: Coarse BS bilaterally Cardiac: Regular, II/VI HSM at apex, no S3 or S4 Abdomen: obese, sl distended, nt, pos BS GU: No scrotal edema Extr: Trace LE swelling.  Upper extremities with 2+ pitting edema in the forearms. Skin: Stage 2 coccyx ulcer. Neuro: Arousable, followed simple commands like open mouth or eyes.  Can barely move hands, and is not able to move toes.  Pertinent Results: EKG: NSR 78 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, deep q in II, III, aVF. GOod RWP.  Consistent with prior from [**2198-2-14**]. . Imaging: . CXR: Persistent atelectasis within the right perihilar region and left lung base. Tip of right subclavian central venous catheter overlie the proximal right atrium. Recommend partially withdrawing. . Abd u/s [**11-2**] FINDINGS: There is no ascites identified in the abdomen. No new liver masses are identified, and there is no biliary dilatation identified. Doppler examination of the TIPS shunt demonstrate flow within the shunt which is wall- to-wall, however, the distal portion of the shunt shows some narrowing. Velocities within the TIPS shunt are 30, 96, and 282 in the proximal, mid and distal portions respectively. Elevated velocities within the distal portion are concerning for a distal stenosis. Flow in the main portal vein is hepatopetal and is 44 cm/sec. Some flow away from the TIPS shunt is identified within the anterior right portal vein. Flow within the left portal vein is still demonstrated towards the TIPS shunt on this exam.  Brief Hospital Course: A/P [**11-11**]: 63M h/o ESLD [**1-19**] NASH, HCC, seizure disorder, DM2, hypothyroidism, poor baseline mental status (unable to speak, unable to move extremities at baseline per wife), admitted from rehab via [**Name (NI) **] with fevers, hypotension, profound dehydration, and electrolyte derangements, now with improved mental status after rehydration. . # Fevers/hypotension: His initial presentation was felt to be concerning for sepsis in light of fevers prior to admission. Patient was determined to be severely hypovolemic in the ED, and was given 7 liters of normal saline.  His BP improved and has since remained stable.  The possible sources of infection were felt to include decubitus ulcer, GI/diarrhea, UTI, pulmonary. He was initially covered with linezolid with history of VRE, which was switched to daptomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole for broad coverage.  His chest x-ray showed no pneumonia.  He had no recurrent fevers and blood and urine cultures and stool C. diff were negative.  His antibiotics were subsequently removed and his vitals remained stable.  Given this clinical picture, hypovolemia from dehydration rather than sepsis was considered the most likely cause of hypotension. . # Seizures: Patient had a recent prolonged admission with refractory seizures, necessitating pentobarbital coma at one point.  Seizures during his prior admission were primarily absence in nature, as he would stare off and become non-responsive, but no rhythmic motions were noted.  The Epilepsy service was consulted to assist with management of his several anti-epileptics.  Given his low albumin, corrected phenytoin levels (goal 20-30) and free phenytoin levels (goal 2-2.5) were followed.  His phenytoin dose was slightly decreased.  Continuous EEG monitoring x 2 days demonstrated slow background but no rhythmic epileptiform activities, ruling out subclinical seizures.  He was continued on his prior regimen of phenytoin (at a lower dose), zonismaide, levetiracetam, and topiramate.  He was also placed on lorazepam 0.75 mg TID for seizure prophylaxis in the setting of lowered seizure threshold.  His phenytoin dose was further decreased to 150mg per PEG TID after his free phenytoin level returned elevated at 2.9.  He should have a free phenytoin level checked on [**2198-11-16**] and again on [**2198-11-19**], and the results should be communicated to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3506**].  She will determine any further dose adjustments.  He should also continue on his current dose of lorazepam until [**2198-11-26**], when it should be decreased to 0.5mg IV Q8H.  He was discharged on these medications with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70525**].  Please contact her at the above number for any questions regarding his antiepileptic medication regimen. . # AMS: Although patient is minimally responsive to commands, this current mental status and functional status (rigidity and limited ability to move extremities) is his new baseline. Wife stated patient is the \"best\" he has been since [**2198-7-18**].  He had periods of increased lucidity with orientation to person and place.  His ammonia was followed and was found to be higher than previous levels.  He was maintained on lactulose and his rifaximin was increased.  Antiepileptic management as above.  He remained at his baseline mental status for the remainder of his stay. . # UGIB: On [**11-8**], patient had coffee-ground emesis.  His Dobhoff was removed and tube feedings were held.  Noticed some brown mucous at trach site.  NG lavage showed coffee grounds but no bright red blood.  His Hct was stable from prior days at 24.9. He received 3 U PRBCs with an increase in his Hct to 30.9.  His aspirin and SC heparin were held, and he was placed on a PPI [**Hospital1 **].  EGD on [**11-9**] showed small hiatal hernia and grade B esophagitis with contact bleeding in the lower third of the esophagus.  PEG tube was placed on [**11-9**] and he has been tolerating tube feeds.  His hematocrit has remained stable at 29.  His SC heparin was restarted.  Consider holding aspirin for 2 weeks (to restart on [**11-18**]) to allow mucosa to heal, in light of risk of recurrent life-threatening GI bleeding.  He was maintained on a PPI. . # Hypernatremia:  Hypernatremia to 166 on admission was considered most likley due to hypovolemia given his clinical exam and improvement with replacement of his 8L free water deficit.  He also received free water boluses via PEG tube.  His sodium level remained stable. . # CAD: Patient has history of CAD, and had elevated troponin on admission, but was unable to give a history of chest pain. Acute renal failure was considered a possible contributor to elevated troponin levels, and his CK trended downwards.  His beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor were initially held in the setting of hypotension.  His aspirin was held in the setting of an upper GI bleed as above.  His home beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor were restarted after he remained stable after GI bleed.  His blood pressure has remained stable. . # Decubitus ulcer / heel blisters: Pt was admitted with stage 2 ulcer on coccyx and pressure blisters on heels.  Wound care and Plastic Surgery consults were obtained and recommendations followed.  A rectal tube was placed for hygiene and he may need fecal diversion in the future.  Patient will need follow up with Plastic Surgery post-discharge. . # ESLD/cirrhosis: He has a history of HCC and NASH cirrhosis, and is s/p TIPS after a GI bleed.  He was previously considered for liver transplant but has been delisted due to his baseline mental status.  A RUQ US was performed on admission with some concern for TIPS stenosis.  IR assessed the TIPS under fluoroscopy and found mild narrowing but no hemodynamically significant stenosis.  His ammonia level was found to be elevated from baseline as above, although his mental status remained at baseline.  He was maintained on lactulose and his rifaximin was increased. . # Pancytopenia: Patient was found to be pancytopenic (but not neutropenic) on admission, with low platelets and leukopenia thought likely secondary to chronic liver disease/sequestration, and low hematocrit thought likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.  His WBC and platelet counts remained stable.  His hematocrit was stable after resuscitation from GI bleed as above.  Further workup was deferred to the outpatient setting. . # ARF: Creatinine was 1.9 on admission (greatly increased from baseline of 0.5), considered likely prerenal given hypovolemia. It improved greatly with fluid resuscitation and has remained stable at 0.4-0.5. . # DM2 uncontrolled with complications: Prior to admission, fingersticks had been trending upwards at rehab.  NPH and RISS titrated to maintain FS <150.  On ACE-inhibitor as above. . # Hypothyroidism: Continued home regimen of levothyroxine 200mcg daily. . # Respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy: No respiratory difficulties during this admission with stable oxygen saturation on baseline 35% trach mask.
